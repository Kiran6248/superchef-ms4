While many people swear by them, there are still others who remain unaware of the benefits of these non-stick pans against regular ones to commit to making the shift.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut how about we start from the beginning… what are non-stick pans? These are pans engineered to prevent and reduce instances of food sticking to the surface and causing the pan to brown. Different Superchef non-stick pans come with different types of coating that not only prevent food from sticking to the pan, but also are healthy, and allow for no-oil to low oil cooking. There are some things to keep in mind to ensure that food is cooked properly and the pan does not see wear and tear too quickly from daily use.\r\n\r\nWhen you cook food in a regular pan, it goes without question that you will need to use oil to prevent the food from sticking to the surface and to ensure the food cooks properly and evenly. But when you cook with non-stick induction pans, you do not require even a drop of oil. This means that as you use non-stick induction pans, your meals will become healthier. Simply using non-stick cookware is a small step towards losing weight and looking fab.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to make the move towards a smarter kitchen, then non-stick is the way to go. Non-stick induction cookware evenly distributes heat throughout the vessel or pan in use and helps the food cook faster. By coupling the use of non-stick cookware with some easy cooking hacks, you’re sure to save enough time to finally get around to kicking back with that novel that’s been gathering dust or catching up with your favorite TV show.\r\nOne of the greatest benefits of cooking with non-stick pans is how easy they are to clean. You no longer have to break out the scrubber to clean the grease or particles of burnt food stuck to the vessel. Ensure you use a sponge with dish soap mixed in mildly hot water to clean the pan to prevent the non-stick coating from starting to flake too soon.", "image": "blog2.png", "image_url": "", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.blogpost", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Eating Mindfully during Covid-19 Pandemic", "created_on": "2021-07-05T19:41:48.649Z", "updated_on": "2021-07-05T19:41:48.649Z", "slug": "eating-mindfully-during-covid-19-pandemic", "author": 1, "body": "The number of people testing positive for COVID-19 has seen an alarming spike causing the WHO to declare the outbreak as a pandemic. Travel bans have been imposed worldwide, and countries have implemented lockdowns to safeguard its people. During a global crisis of this scale, practicing different methods of self-care is more important now than ever. While washing your hands properly and social distancing are the best ways to fight the coronavirus disease, there are other practices you should consider incorporating into your lifestyle. \r\nEating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting the recommended amount of proper sleep all contribute to this. You should also refrain from smoking, and should think about limiting alcohol consumption. \r\nVegetables have to be on top of the list since they offer the most nutrients. However, eating your greens doesn’t have to be such a chore! Mix things up by experimenting with different recipes. Mushrooms are considered great foods to boost immunity, so adding a handful to your pasta or in your sandwich will not only add taste and texture but will also increase your intake of immune-boosting vitamins and minerals. You can even toss in a few in your paneer gravy to make it extra creamy!\r\nThere’s a long list of fruits that boost immunity, but the best ones are citrus fruits. This is because they offer the highest amount of vitamin C, which is an important and essential nutrient for the body. Vitamin C also helps produce white blood cells and builds the immune system. Since the body does not naturally produce or store vitamin C, oranges, grapefruits, and lemons should be incorporated into your diet. Add a few to a colorful fruit salad, or squeeze out some fresh orange juice or lemonade for you and your loved ones. \r\nNuts and seeds are some of the best immune-boosting foods. You can never go wrong with almonds, walnuts, or sunflower seeds. Most nuts are actually packed with healthy fats, as well as antioxidants and essential vitamins that the body needs. To add to that, eating a handful of almonds can help you meet your daily vitamin E requirements as well!\r\nCertain types of dairy, like cheese and yoghurt, are extremely beneficial for the body and the immune system. Yoghurt contains probiotics that help fight diseases and improves gut health better than any other food. Cheese contains zinc, which also boosts the immune system and fights disease in the body.", "image": "blog1.png", "image_url": "", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "Rishi satyarthy", "email": "rishi@gmail.com", "body": "This blog is very informative and is useful during these times.
